  <h2>Education</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>At my school, <a href="https://sites.google.com/ps170.com/20k170/home">P.S.170</a>, my favorite subject is Art
      (As you've already imagined.)</li>
    <li>At Art, I have a considerable amount of projects made.</li>
    <li>In 2018, I won an Art Medal for the Fall Poster Painting. Let me just tell you, it was truly awesome.</li>
