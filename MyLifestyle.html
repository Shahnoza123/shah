    <h1>MyLifestyle</h1>
    <p>I usually wake up every morning and start Google Classroom even BEFORE eating breakfast. This is because I usually have a meeting at 10:00 A.M., and wake up at 9 something A.M. Which is so not fair ðŸ˜¡</p>
    <p>But anyways, besides that, I obviously draw after doing all my homework, or I either surf through the web for some tea, or I can simply read a book, depending on my mood.</p>
    <p>Later in the day, I eat Lunch and do some other things, like coding, etc. I then eat Dinner and then go to bed which is usually at 11 or 12 P.M./A.M. Don't ask.</P>

    <p>And that's pretty much it for my Life everday!</p>
