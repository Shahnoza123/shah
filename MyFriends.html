    <h1>My Friends</h1>
    <p><a>I have had friends ever since 1st grade (maybe kindergarten but I don't remember) and these were the most best friend God ever gave me. Their names were Sehar, Vicky, and Jaelynn. </p></a>
    <p>Me and Sehar have been the closest ever since, but somewhere around fourth grade, Vicky and Jaelynn were in different classes than me and Sehar. The more we went to different grades, Vic and Jae were becoming less friends with Sehar and I. But I will still have them known as my friends in the deepest of my heart.</p></a>
    <p>Fast forward in 5th grade, I found more friends, since Sehar and I got separated in 5th grade, but that didn't stop us from becoming the most best of friends. The friends I found in 5th grade you may be wondering were named Isabella, Tiffany, Iris, Heidi, and others. Everyone was so good friends to me, and were dependable. I am so happy to have friends to this day.</<p></a>
